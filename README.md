# ML-Roulette

## About

Welcome to **ML-Roulette** - a fun machine learning challenge game that generates random combinations of ML pipeline components to create exciting coding challenges. Everything will be vibe-coded, almost nothing will be hand coded. Think of this as art where you pick up some brush, paint and get lost in the muse. No brain, only vibes.


I'll be **livestreaming** my attempts at solving these random ML challenges on **Twitch** for fun.

## How It Works

Spin the roulette to get a random combination of:

### **Data Types**
- **a.** Tabular
- **b.** Text  
- **c.** Images
- **d.** **Joker** (Wild card!)

### **Models**
- **a.** Linear
- **b.** MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- **c.** CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **d.** RNN (LSTM/GRU)
- **e.** Transformers (Encoder/Decoder)
- **f.** Tree-based (Random Forests, GBDTs)
- **g.** SVMs (Support Vector Machines)
- **h.** **Joker** (Wild card!)

### **Tasks**
- **a.** Regression
- **b.** Binary Classification
- **c.** Multi-class Classification
- **d.** Multi-label Multi-class Classification
- **e.** Dimensionality Reduction
- **f.** Anomaly Detection
- **g.** Clustering
- **h.** **Joker** (Wild card!)

Many of these combinations won't be the most efficient way to solve the task but they will make up for fun little experiments. If it's an impossible combination, we will just struggle to no end and make "artistic" assumptions to bring our ideas to life.
